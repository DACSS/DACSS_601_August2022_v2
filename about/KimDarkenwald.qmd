## Education/Work Background
I currently hold a B.A. in Journalism and Mass Communication with an emphasis in public relations.  Shortly after graduating college, many years ago, my grandmother fell ill and required around-the-clock.   For this reason, I placed my professional life on hold to care for her. Since her passing at the age of 105 years old, I have decided to change course and pursue a career in data analytics.  


## R experience
The DACSS 601 class will be my introduction to R and I am looking forward to learning the program. 


## Research interests
I have a strong interest in Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) issues. 


## Hometown
Valhalla, NY


## Hobbies
Playing with my dog, sailing, skiing, anything to do with comedy.


## Fun fact
Sharks never stop growing.
