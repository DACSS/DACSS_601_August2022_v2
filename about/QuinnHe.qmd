## Education/Work Background

I recently graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021 with a BA in English and a minor in Psychology. Afterwards, I worked for one year in retail while taking courses for the DACSS certificate. I wanted to further my education and applied to the DACSS MS program, which I am starting this Fall 2022.

## R experience

I have beginner/intermediate experience in R. For the year year I was working, I would study R in my spare time to keep my skills sharp. I still have much to learn when it comes to R/RStudio

## Research interests

I have not fully honed in my research interests, but I hope to come out of the program with extensive knowledge in the technical skills of data analysis and research.

## Hometown

Wayne, NJ

## Hobbies

I enjoy playing guitar, biking, reading, and cooking.

## Fun fact

I met  Jesse Eisenberg at an empty movie theater in NYC.
