## Education/Work Background

I spent my freshman year of undergrad at Simmons University in Boston and then in 2019 I transferred to UMass Amherst for my sophomore year. I graduated this past May with a B.A in Communication and am continuing my education at UMass with the DACSS program.

## R experience

I have very limited amount of experience with R. I took a sociology course about data collection and analysis, which introduced me to research design and how data is obtained and analyzed. I used R for my final research which made me interested to learn and use R more.

## Research interests

Some of my research interests include digital inequalities, media effects especially in children, and disinformation.

## Hometown

I am originally from Framingham Massachusetts.

## Hobbies

I like to go to the beach, hang out with my family and friends, take my dog on walks, and listen to live music.

## Fun fact
A fun fat about me is that my first ever concert that I went to was the Cheetah Girls and Vanessa Hudgens.
