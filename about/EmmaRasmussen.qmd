## Education/Work Background
I graduated in 2021 with a B.S. in Public Health and Anthropology/Sociology and a minor in Biology from Roger Williams University. Since graduating, I completed a research internship with the Framingham Heart Study for their Brain Aging Program. In between, I have spent a lot of time working in restaurants.
