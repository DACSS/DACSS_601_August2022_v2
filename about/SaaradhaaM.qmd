## Background 🌱

I received an Honours degree in Psychology from the National University of Singapore, then worked in government and industry. I'm currently a graduate student in the DACSS program.

## R Experience 💡

I took Microsoft's Introduction to R course in 2020. However, the bulk of my R experience will be coming from DACSS 601. I'm excited to learn!

## Research Interests 🔍

Group dynamics, implicit social cognition, inclusivity and networks in STEM

## Hometown 🇸🇬

I was born and raised in [Singapore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwYpr7UJFFI), a small city in Asia.

## Hobbies 🐾

-   I picked up yoga during the pandemic.

-   I do a cappella with my college friends.

-   Other things I enjoy include travel, hiking and trying new food.

## Fun Fact ⭐️

I am left-handed, but I play string instruments right-handed because those who taught me were right-handed.
