## Education/Work Background

I am a lecturer, academic advisor, and general do-it-all person for the DACSS program. I was a part of the first cohort of DACSS students who started Fall 2020. I graduated this May and am thrilled to be able to continue working with everyone on the DACSS team.

M.S. DACSS - May 2022 

B.A. in Economics & American Studies from UMass Lowell

## R experience

I learned a lot during my two years in the program, but there is so much more to learn. The RStudio Conference has really thrown me for a loop; things change faster than I can keep up.

The next big goal is to get comfortable using tidymodels and associated packages.

## Research interests

Too indecisive to identify my own research interests, but I'd love to give you my two cents about yours.

## Hometown

Andover, MA

## Hobbies

being stressed

## Fun fact

The TV show The Sopranos was named after my family (supposedly---at least according to some distant cousin).
