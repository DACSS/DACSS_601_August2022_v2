## Education/Work Background
UMass Amherst - BS in Math (Concentration in statistics)
Montgomery College Rockville - AS in Math
Cogentiv Solutions Llc. - Database Management
World Data Science Institute - Data Science Researcher

## R experience
R is pretty much my favorite language. I was introduced to R before I graduated high school, and started actively pursuing it by the time I started coming to UMass Amherst.

## Research interests
My research interests are actually very broad, but lately, my interests are leaning more towards environmental and agricultural research. I also have interests in what affects a city's median household income, or the wellbeing of people who live in those cities.

## Hometown
Haydenville, MA

## Hobbies
- Painting
- Drawing
- Magnet fishing
- Video games

## Fun fact
I used to be Mormon, but I left before graduating high school.
