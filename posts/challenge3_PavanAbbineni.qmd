## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organicpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.csv 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}
animalWeights<-read_csv("_data/animal_weight.csv",
                        show_col_types = FALSE)

```

```{r head}
head(animalWeights)
```
```{r dimensions}
dim(animalWeights)
```

```{r colnames}
colnames(animalWeights)
```

### Briefly describe the data

The data shows average animal weights per location. We will combine the animal name columns into one column to clean up the data.

## Anticipate the End Result

The first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product *should* look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.

One easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.

Suppose you have a dataset with $n$ rows and $k$ variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting $k-3$ variables into a longer format where the $k-3$ variable names will move into the `names_to` variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the `values_to` variable. Therefore, we would expect $n * (k-3)$ rows in the pivoted dataframe!

### Example: find current and future data dimensions

Lets see if this works with a simple example.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Example

df<-tibble(country = rep(c("Mexico", "USA", "France"),2),
           year = rep(c(1980,1990), 3), 
           trade = rep(c("NAFTA", "NAFTA", "EU"),2),
           outgoing = rnorm(6, mean=1000, sd=500),
           incoming = rlogis(6, location=1000, 
                             scale = 400))
df

#existing rows/cases
nrow(df)

#existing columns/cases
ncol(df)

#expected rows/cases
nrow(df) * (ncol(df)-3)

# expected columns 
3 + 2
```

Or simple example has $n = 6$ rows and $k - 3 = 2$ variables being pivoted, so we expect a new dataframe to have $n * 2 = 12$ rows x $3 + 2 = 5$ columns.

### Challenge: Describe the final dimensions


Our original dataset has a total of 9 rows and 17 columns.  
Out of these 17 columns except the country column the other 16 columns need to be pivoted.
In the new dataset the number of rows in the expected dataset is 9*16.
New dataset is 144x3.

```{r}
nrow(animalWeights)
ncol(animalWeights)


nrow(animalWeights)*(ncol(animalWeights)-1)

```

Any additional comments?

## Pivot the Data

Now we will pivot the data, and compare our pivoted data dimensions to the dimensions calculated above as a "sanity" check.

### Example

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Pivoted Example

df<-pivot_longer(df, col = c(outgoing, incoming),
                 names_to="trade_direction",
                 values_to = "trade_value")
df
```

Yes, once it is pivoted long, our resulting data are $12x5$ - exactly what we expected!

### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data

Document your work here. What will a new "case" be once you have pivoted the data? How does it meet requirements for tidy data?

```{r}
newPivotedData<-pivot_longer(animalWeights, col = c(2:17),
                 names_to="animal_type",
                 values_to = "weight")

```

```{r pivotedData}
head(newPivotedData)
```
```{r}
dim(newPivotedData)
```
Any additional comments?

The expected dimensions of our pivoted data aligns with our experimentally calculated value.
