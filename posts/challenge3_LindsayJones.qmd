## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1.  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2.  identify what needs to be done to tidy the current data
3.  anticipate the shape of pivoted data
4.  pivot the data into tidy format using `pivot_longer`

## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organicpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.csv 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}
animal_weight<-read_csv("_data/animal_weight.csv",
                        show_col_types = FALSE)
print(animal_weight)
```

### Briefly describe the data

This data set contains the average weight of 17 different groups of animals in 9 regions of the world. This data set is not tidy because the variables (animal species and average weight) are not set as the columns. Using pivot_longer will fix that. 

### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data


```{r}
aw_pivot <- pivot_longer(animal_weight, 
             "Cattle - dairy":"Llamas", 
             names_to = "Species",
             values_to = "Weight")
print(aw_pivot)

```

This format makes it more difficult to look at the data for each country, but this could be solved using a few different functions. If we wanted to examine both types of cattle in every country:

```{r}
aw_pivot %>%
  filter(grepl('Cattle', Species))
```
