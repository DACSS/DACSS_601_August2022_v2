## 1) Read in a data set, and describe the data using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc).
## 2) Provide summary statistics for different interesting groups within the data, and interpret those statistics.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

#For this challenge, I will read in "railroad_2012_clean_county.csv." This dataset shows the number of railroad employees in each county in each state.
```

```{r}
countyrr_data <- read.csv("_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv")
head(countyrr_data)
```

```{r}
dim(countyrr_data)
```

```{r}
#For confirmation, I got the dimensions of the table. With 2,930 rows, it must be filtered down and grouped in some way in order to present specific information. 

#I'm going to start by finding the county in each state that had the fewest postal employees
```
