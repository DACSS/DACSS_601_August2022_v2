```

## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to

1)  read in a dataset, and

2)  describe the dataset using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)

## Read in the Data

Read in one (or more) of the following data sets, using the correct R package and command.

-   railroad_2012_clean_county.csv ⭐
-   birds.csv ⭐⭐
-   FAOstat\*.csv ⭐⭐
-   wild_bird_data.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐
-   StateCounty2012.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Find the `_data` folder, located inside the `posts` folder. Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.

```{r}
library(readxl)
railroad <- read_csv("_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv")
railroad
#import the railroad 2012 data into R
```

Add any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.

## Describe the data

Using a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).

```{r}
#| label: summary
spec(railroad)
dim(railroad)
colnames(railroad)
```
