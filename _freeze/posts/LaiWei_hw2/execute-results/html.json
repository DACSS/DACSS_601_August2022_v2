If you decide to use one of the datasets we have provided, please use a challenging dataset - check with us if you are not sure. \n-Clean the data as needed using dplyr and related tidyverse packages.\n-Provide a narrative about the data set (look it up if you aren't sure what you have got) and the variables in your dataset, including what type of data each variable is. The goal of this step is to communicate in a visually appealing way to non-experts - not to replicate r-code.\n-Identify potential research questions that your dataset can help answer\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(2,3,4,5)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Rendering your post\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. \n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nBe sure that you have moved your `*.qmd` file into the `posts` folder **BEFORE** you render it, so that all files are stored in the correct location.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nOnly render a single file - don't try to render the whole website!\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Pilot Student Blogs\n\nWe are piloting a workflow including individual student websites with direted and limited pull requests back to course blogs. Please let us know if you would like to participate.\n:::\n\n## Reading in data files\n\nThe easiest data source to use - at least initially - is to choose something easily accessible, either from our `_data` folder provided, or from an online source that is publicly available.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Other Data\nIf you would like to use a source that you have access to and it is small enough and you don't mind making it public, you can copy it into the `_data` file and include in your *commit* and *pull request*.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Private Data\n\nIf you would like to use a proprietary source of data, that should be possible using the same process outlined above. There may initially be a few issues. We hope to have this feature working smoothly soon!\n:::",
