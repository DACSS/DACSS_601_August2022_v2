More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n    So, essentially, this data is interpreting the value of livestock around the world. The values are either official or unofficial data, or FAO estimates. \n    \n    The data has a total of over 82k slots. Value is the only quantitative variable. Each set of data was recorded between the years of 1961 and 2018. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(FAOstat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Domain Code           Domain            Area Code          Area          \n Length:82116       Length:82116       Min.   :   1.0   Length:82116      \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:  73.0   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median : 146.0   Mode  :character  \n                                       Mean   : 912.7                     \n                                       3rd Qu.: 221.0                     \n                                       Max.   :5504.0                     \n                                                                          \n  Element Code    Element            Item Code        Item          \n Min.   :5111   Length:82116       Min.   : 866   Length:82116      \n 1st Qu.:5111   Class :character   1st Qu.: 976   Class :character  \n Median :5111   Mode  :character   Median :1034   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :5111                      Mean   :1018                     \n 3rd Qu.:5111                      3rd Qu.:1096                     \n Max.   :5111                      Max.   :1126                     \n                                                                    \n   Year Code         Year          Unit               Value          \n Min.   :1961   Min.   :1961   Length:82116       Min.   :0.000e+00  \n 1st Qu.:1976   1st Qu.:1976   Class :character   1st Qu.:1.250e+04  \n Median :1991   Median :1991   Mode  :character   Median :2.247e+05  \n Mean   :1990   Mean   :1990                      Mean   :1.163e+07  \n 3rd Qu.:2005   3rd Qu.:2005                      3rd Qu.:2.377e+06  \n Max.   :2018   Max.   :2018                      Max.   :1.490e+09  \n                                                  NA's   :1301       \n     Flag           Flag Description  \n Length:82116       Length:82116      \n Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                      \n                                      \n                                      \n                                      \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`.

Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.\n\n    This specific group I chose involved sheep and official data. Since the value changes every year, I chose to take the average value and standard deviation of sheep for each year. What appears to be happening here is the mean is the average value of sheep appears to be relatively stagnant between the years 2000 and 2010. After 2010, the official data shows a major surplus in the value of sheep. ",
