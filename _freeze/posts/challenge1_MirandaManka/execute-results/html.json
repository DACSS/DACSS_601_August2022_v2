It is hard to tell more about this data without other information, such as the types of birds or how/when/where the data were collected, although if I had to guess, I would say that it was probably collected in forests or other outdoor areas with many birds because the title of the dataset indicates they are wild birds.\n\nInterestingly, the actual variable names seem to be in the next row instead of the labels the data currently has (the variables should be \"Wet body weight [g]\" for the first variable/column instead of \"Reference\", and \"Population size\" for the second instead of \"Taken from Figure 1 of Nee et al.\")\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Work to correct variable/column names\n#Remove first row\nwild_bird_data <- wild_bird_data[-c(1), ]\n#Rename columns/variables\nwild_bird_data = rename(wild_bird_data, wet_body_weight_g = Reference)\nwild_bird_data = rename(wild_bird_data, population_size = `Taken from Figure 1 of Nee et al.`)\n#Create value to use from each column\nwet_body_weight_g = wild_bird_data[, 1]\npopulation_size = wild_bird_data[, 2]\n\n#Change type\nwet_body_weight_g = as.numeric(unlist(wet_body_weight_g))\npopulation_size = as.numeric(unlist(population_size))\n\n#Summary of variables\nsummary(wet_body_weight_g)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Min.  1st Qu.

This indicates that there is likely a large variety in the types of birds and/or the geographical location of the birds in these measurements.\n",
