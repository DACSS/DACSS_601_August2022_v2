And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - eggs ⭐\n  - abc_poll ⭐⭐\n  - australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n  - hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n  - air_bnb  ⭐⭐⭐\n  - us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n  - faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neggs <- read_csv(\"_data/eggs_tidy.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neggs <- pivot_longer(eggs, col = c(large_half_dozen, large_dozen, extra_large_half_dozen, extra_large_dozen),\n                              names_to = \"Egg Package Type\",\n                              values_to = \"Average Price\")\n\neggs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 480 × 4\n   month     year `Egg Package Type`     `Average Price`\n   <chr>    <dbl> <chr>                            <dbl>\n 1 January   2004 large_half_dozen                  126 \n 2 January   2004 large_dozen                       230 \n 3 January   2004 extra_large_half_dozen            132 \n 4 January   2004 extra_large_dozen                 230 \n 5 February  2004 large_half_dozen                  128.\n 6 February  2004 large_dozen                       226.\n 7 February  2004 extra_large_half_dozen            134.\n 8 February  2004 extra_large_dozen                 230 \n 9 March     2004 large_half_dozen                  131 \n10 March     2004 large_dozen                       225 \n# … with 470 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nI believe that everything is taken care of in terms of the data. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\n\n\n",
