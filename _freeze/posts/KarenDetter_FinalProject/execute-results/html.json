However, when the dust settled and the official post-election numbers were crunched by the Pew Research Center, this narrative was challenged by the fact that 47% of white women had voted for Trump (Pew Research Center, 2019, p.11). Instead of allying with a fellow female who ostensibly shared at least some of their individual priorities, these women supported a man well-known for his sexism and boorish behavior towards women.\n\nWho are these women who voted for Donald Trump in 2016? In what ways do they differ from the women who voted for Hillary Clinton? The UMass Poll, a survey that collects public opinion data on a wide variety of political and social issues, may be able to provide some insight into these questions.\n\n\n# Data\n\nThe specific UMass poll data used for this analysis was collected in April 2021. The frame was constructed using stratified sampling aligned to the American Community Survey, and the final dataset consists of 1000 unique observations. Since the data is organized using SPSS, the file is read into R using the 'haven' package and the contents are viewed:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nApril_UMass_Poll <- read_sav(\"posts/_data/April_UMass_Poll.sav\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in read_sav(\"posts/_data/April_UMass_Poll.sav\"): could not find function \"read_sav\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(April_UMass_Poll)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in as.data.frame(x): object 'April_UMass_Poll' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Visualization\n\nsummary tables, crosstabs, and bar charts\n\n\n# Reflection\n\nmention tutorials, homeworks, and SPSS transition\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nfrom OpEd paper-conclusions and questions left unanswered after analysis\n\n\n# References\n\nlist of sources",
