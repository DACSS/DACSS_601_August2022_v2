More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The dataset contains 2930 entries each showing the number of rail road employees in a US county. The data is categorized statewise. The data is taken from counties that have atleast one employee working in the rail road. Cook, IL has the most number of employees with a head count of 8207. \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngroup_by(railroad, state)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n# Groups:   state [53]\n   state county               total_employees\n   <chr> <chr>                          <dbl>\n 1 AE    APO                                2\n 2 AK    ANCHORAGE                          7\n 3 AK    FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR               2\n 4 AK    JUNEAU                             3\n 5 AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA                  2\n 6 AK    SITKA                              1\n 7 AK    SKAGWAY MUNICIPALITY              88\n 8 AL    AUTAUGA                          102\n 9 AL    BALDWIN                          143\n10 AL    BARBOUR                            1\n# … with 2,920 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Explain and Interpret\n\nBe sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.\n",
