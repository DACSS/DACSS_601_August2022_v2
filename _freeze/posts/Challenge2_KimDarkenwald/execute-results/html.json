Here are the following questions I have for this code chunk:\n\n1. Why \"skip = 4?\"\n2. I assume the \"delete\" is to delete the empty columns between \"state\", \"county\", and employees\", however, I don't understand the \"filter(!str_detect(state,\"Total\"))\n3. I don't understand the \"-2\" in the next line.\n4. I'm assuming the last line has two CANADAs in it so that if the \"state\" has \"CANADA\" in it, it means the system should put \"CANADA\" as the county?\n5. Why can't I see the \"New names:\"?\n\n\n## Describe the data\n\nRailroad employee totals were gathered for states and their respective counties across the US as well as data from Canada.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect(railroad, filter(railroad, \"state\", n_distinct))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in `select()`:\n! Problem while computing `..1 = \"state\"`.\n✖ Input `..1` must be a logical vector, not a character.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarise(railroad, \"state\", \"total\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  `\"state\"` `\"total\"`\n  <chr>     <chr>    \n1 state     total    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarize(total_employees = sum (employees))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in summarize(total_employees = sum(employees)): object 'employees' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Explain and Interpret\n\nBe sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.",
