Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAny additional comments?\n\n    I believe the data is already tidy. Each value has its own column, and there's not much to do. However, I noticed that the year column seems to be backwards, and the price values don't round up to two digits. I'm not sure if that's a problem.\n    \n## Identify variables that need to be mutated\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, are all time variables correctly coded as dates? Are all string variables reduced and cleaned to sensible categories? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoultry_tidy %>%\n  arrange(Product, Year) %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(Price_Dollar), funs(round(., digit = 2)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 600 x 4\n   Product     Year Month     Price_Dollar\n   <chr>      <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>\n 1 B/S Breast  2004 January           6.46\n 2 B/S Breast  2004 February          6.42\n 3 B/S Breast  2004 March             6.42\n 4 B/S Breast  2004 April             6.42\n 5 B/S Breast  2004 May               6.42\n 6 B/S Breast  2004 June              6.41\n 7 B/S Breast  2004 July              6.42\n 8 B/S Breast  2004 August            6.42\n 9 B/S Breast  2004 September         6.42\n10 B/S Breast  2004 October           6.42\n# ... with 590 more rows\n# i Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAny additional comments?\n\n    While the data might be tidy, you should also check and make sure the values are entered in a way that makes sense.
