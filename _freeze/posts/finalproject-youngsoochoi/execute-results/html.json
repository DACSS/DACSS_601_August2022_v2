As a public official in Korea (even though I am not in charge of economic policy), I have experienced how economic problems affect not only our daily lives but also the government.\n\nFrom this point of view, I chose the US economy as the subject of my final project of DACSS 601. This is because the U.S. economy has a great impact on the global economy due to its size and openness, and I wanted to check the theory and contents of economics that I learned when I was an undergraduate.\n\nI selected several research topics using the 'federal funds rate' data used in class.\n\nThe first is to look at the general picture of the U.S. economy. I will visualize and examine the real gdp changes in the US economy since the 50s.\n\nSecond, I'll draw the famous Phillips curve, which represents the trade-off between unemployment and inflation, using real data from the United States, and see how the trade-off between the two really looks.\n\nLastly, I'll look at whether the target interest rate of the U.S. monetary policy authorities is for inflation management as I learned in the textbook. If the monetary authorities' top policy goal is inflation management, they will raise the target interest rate when inflation is high to stabilize prices, and the correlation between the two will be high.\n\n## Read and Tidy Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read Federal Funds Rate data\n\nfedfundsrate_org<-read_csv(\"_data/FedFundsRate.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nfedfundsrate_org\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 904 × 10\n    Year Month   Day Federal F…¹ Feder…² Feder…³ Effec…⁴ Real …⁵ Unemp…⁶ Infla…⁷\n   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>       <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1  1954     7     1          NA      NA      NA    0.8      4.6     5.8      NA\n 2  1954     8     1          NA      NA      NA    1.22    NA       6        NA\n 3  1954     9     1          NA      NA      NA    1.06    NA       6.1      NA\n 4  1954    10     1          NA      NA      NA    0.85     8       5.7      NA\n 5  1954    11     1          NA      NA      NA    0.83    NA       5.3      NA\n 6  1954    12     1          NA      NA      NA    1.28    NA       5        NA\n 7  1955     1     1          NA      NA      NA    1.39    11.9     4.9      NA\n 8  1955     2     1          NA      NA      NA    1.29    NA       4.7      NA\n 9  1955     3     1          NA      NA      NA    1.35    NA       4.6      NA\n10  1955     4     1          NA      NA      NA    1.43     6.7     4.7      NA\n# … with 894 more rows, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​`Federal Funds Target Rate`, ²​`Federal Funds Upper Target`,\n#   ³​`Federal Funds Lower Target`, ⁴​`Effective Federal Funds Rate`,\n#   ⁵​`Real GDP (Percent Change)`, ⁶​`Unemployment Rate`, ⁷​`Inflation Rate`\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis data includes dates from 1954 (separated by year, month, and day), and various economic variables. There are seven economic variables included, and if the Federal Funds Target Rate, Federal Funds Upper Target, and Federal Funds Lower Target are considered as one variable of the monetary authorities, the actual data included are five economic variables such as target interest rates, effective federal funds rate, real gdp percent change, unemployment rates, and inflation rates.\n\nThis data contains a lot, but data from April of 2017 and later are missing. So, I found data after 2017 by variable on several web pages. Then, I read each data, organize the data using the pivot function, etc. if necessary, and had combined them into one using the join function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read Federal

In the long run, as the monetary theorist argues, money does not seem to affect real economic variables other than nominal variables. However, in the short term, the trade-off between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate may actually appear.\n\nNow, let's look at the final topic, the policy goals of monetary authorities. \n\nMonetary authorities set target interest rates to intervene in the market, and I will first look at how target interest rates have affected market interest rates(here, The effective federal funds rate). A line graph was drawn using data since 1983 when the target interest rate began to be set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Draw the line graph of target rate and effective federal funds rate\n\nggplot(fin_ffr, (aes(x=date))) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=effr), color = 'red') +\n  geom_line(aes(y=fftr), color = 'blue') + \n  geom_line(aes(y=ffut), color = 'dark blue') +\n  geom_line(aes(y=fflt), color = 'sky blue') +\n  scale_x_date(limits=c(as.Date(\"1982-10-01\"),as.Date(\"2022-07-01\"))) +\n  labs(title = \"Target Rate and Effective Federal Funds Rate\",\n       x=\"Time\",\n       y=\"Rate\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 12))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finalproject-youngsoochoi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe red line is the effective federal funds rate, and the blue line is the monetary authority's target interest rate.(Since 2008, when the upper and lower limits were set, dark blue means upper limit, and bright blue means lower limit)\n\nAs shown in the figure, the target interest rate and the effective federal funds rate are almost identical. Therefore, for ease of analysis, I will consider the policy intention of the monetary authorities as the effective federal funds rate.\n\nSo my concern would be how much the effective federal funds rate and the inflation rate move together. If the policy authorities value the inflation rate, as a policy tool, the effective federal funds rate and the inflation rate will show a high correlation.\nFirst, I analyzed the correlation between the two variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# An Analysis of the Correlation Between Inflation Rate and The Effective Federal Funds Rate\n\ncor.test(fin_ffr$ir, fin_ffr$effr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tPearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  fin_ffr$ir and fin_ffr$effr\nt = 19.042, df = 257, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.7092358 0.8112382\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.7649925 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(effr~ir, fin_ffr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = effr ~ ir, data = fin_ffr)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)           ir  \n     0.5872       1.1331  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nPearson's correlation coefficient was found to be quite high at 0.765.

However, after 2009, the results were rather lower, which may have been attributed to the fact that the inflation rate was stable at a lower level than before during the period and that the policy environment changed significantly due to COVID-19.\n\nOverall, the monetary authorities' policy goals reflect the inflation rate well, and it can be seen that inflation rate management is their main policy goal.\n\n## Reflection\n\nI summarized the shortcomings and improvements I felt while conducting this task.\n\nFirst, these are matters related to data analysis itself. As an undergraduate, I have dealt with statistical programs such as SPSS, but it is too long ago and never in the case of programming languages such as R. Therefore, the whole process was harder and took longer than I thought. In the future, I will have to get used to coding and continue to improve while attending the DACSS course. \nSpecifically, as it is related to missing values, missing values were not confirmed in the data merger process. It was discovered later while conducting the analysis, but this is the first task and believes in the possibility of future improvement, and the analysis was conducted without missing values. \nIn addition, detailed analysis was conducted separately from each data set, and it is believed that coding could have been performed more efficiently using functions such as group_by. In terms of visualization, including graphs, I think it will be possible to decorate more categories in a better way. \nConsidering these points, I will further improve my coding ability. As mentioned in the class, there is no correct answer to R coding, so I will continue to try to find my own way.\n\nNext, reflection and supplementation points were considered in terms of analysis results. \nRegarding the first research problem, it is thought that more variables related to real GDP growth in the United States can be added to the analysis. Adding population growth rate, capital accumulation rate, and international economic environment related to imports and exports to the analysis, I think the endogenous aspects of U.S. economic development such as technological development can be grasped in more detail. \nSecond, I reached a conclusion that is contrary to our common sense regarding the Phillips curve, and it is thought that the analysis results may be different if the analysis period was divided more accurately using background knowledge on American economic history.\nI felt that my hypothesis was oversimplified in relation to the third research question. In fact, since monetary authorities determine policies based on past inflation rates, adding time variables to the analysis is considered to be a more precise study.\n\n## Conclution\n\nMy research question was about historical trends in the U.S. economy, analysis of the Philips curve, and the relationship between the U.S. monetary authorities' policy objectives and inflation rates.\n\nNow, in relation to the first question, the U.S. economy has seen a real GDP growth rate of about 3% per year, despite several economic crises over the past 70 years.\n\nIn relation to the second problem, it was found that the Phillips curve in the United States has been different from the theory described in textbooks for the past 70 years. But, it was also found that a short-term look at the period may show a negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate in the textbook.\n\nFinally, the U.S. monetary authorities' policy goals and inflation rates have historically shown a fairly high correlation. This suggests that the monetary authorities' policy objectives are closely related to the management of inflation rates.\n\n## Bibiliography\n\n1.
