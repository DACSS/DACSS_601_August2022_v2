Since neither \"NA\" category (row or column) are really relevant to what I'm trying to find, I'm pretty much going to ignore them from this point forward. I'm also going to attempt to remove that row and column altogether.\n\n#As I stated earlier, I was expecting some kind of relationship between the strength of one's religious affiliation and the extent of their social tolerance. I also said that given the very public nature of many of the \"religious person is intolerant\" incidents, I wouldn't be surprised if the relationship was actually the opposite: a relationship between strong religious affiliation and high social tolerance. \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntolerance4religion <- tolerance4religion %>%\n  na.omit()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in na.omit(.): object 'tolerance4religion' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#The NA data has been removed, so I will code the graph again.

The \"somewhat strong\" religious affiliation category, however, doesn't appear to have any kind of relationship with Social Tolerance; the first 3 categories on the x-axis have about the same number of responses. And the \"no religion\" category, interestingly enough, does appear to have a relationship with having a higher level of social tolerance. \n\n#I'd like to explore this topic further. I might use a different variable for the y-axis or I might make a second comparison and analyze both. \n```\n:::\n",
